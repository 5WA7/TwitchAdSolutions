- If you want to use a socks5 proxy:

The first line MUST be the IP of the socks proxy
The second line MUST be the port of the socks proxy

- If you need a user / pass:

The third line MUST be the username
The fourth line MUST be the password

- If you DON'T need a user / pass then the third / fourth line MUST be empty.
- If you DON'T want to use a socks proxy then leave all four lines empty, or delete this file.
